# This repository houses a series of Proofs of Concept C programs that exploit vulnerabilities that I have found in the Android Kernel.

For the most up-to-date list of my bugs see http://plzdonthack.me

For the bugs listed with _mtk.c I didn't bother even trying to compile them as I don't have a mediatek device to test on.
